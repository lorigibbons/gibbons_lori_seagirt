              <h3>About</h3>
              <p>Sea Girt Lighthouse. at Ocean Avenue and Beacon Boulevard in Sea Girt. New Jersey, flashed its first light December 10. 1896. The beacon. which could be seen 15 miles at sea, guided countless mari­ners in their journeys and contributed to the state's economic growth and helped make sailing through local waters safer.</p>
              <p>The lighthouse was built to illuminate a blind spot midway in the38½-mile stretch between Navesink Lighthouse (Twin Lights) to the north and Barnegat Lighthouse to the south. It also served as a land­mark for near by Sea Girt In let and Wreck Pond.</p>
              <p>By the early 1900s. there were some 40 light stations - lighthouses. lightships and range lights - along New Jersey's 130-mile coastline.
              Just over half of them survive. But only 11 of the original lighthouses. including Sea Girt. are open to the public</p>

          <div class="main__text">
            <h3>Achievements</h3>
            <p>The history of Sea Girt Lighthouse is a rich one, filled with numerous distinctions and achievements.
            The red brick structure with a tower rising 44 feet was the last live-in Ii ghth ou se built on the Atlantic Coast. A live-in I ighth ou se has the tower integrated into the living quarters. In the more typical design, to be found at Barnegat and Sandy Hook Lighthouses, the tower is
            separate from the keeper's house. </p>
            <p>Sea Girt was equipped with a fourth order Fresnel lense, which was 30 inches high The multi-sided bee­hive-shape lens had a bulls-eye prism like a big magnifying glass in the middle of each side. A weight dropping down a sh aft called the
            channel caused the lens to revolve on a pedestal.</p>
            <p> The light source - the flame produced by a wick burning kerosene and later oi I -was constant But mariners saw the ii lu si on of a I ight blinking on and off. The Iight was being projected through the first bu II s-eye prism, then
            appeared to go out as it was betvveen prisms, only to fl ash again as the I ight went through the next bu I ls-eye prism and so on.</p>
