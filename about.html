              <h3>About</h3>
              <p>Sea Girt Lighthouse. at Ocean Avenue and Beacon Boulevard in
              Sea Girt. New Jersey, flashed its first light December 10. 1896. The beacon. which could be seen 15 miles at sea. guided countless mari­
              ners in their journeys and contributed to the state's economic growth and helped make sailing through local waters safer.
              The lighthouse was built to illuminate a blind spot midway in the
              38½-mile stretch between Navesink Lighthouse (Twin Lights) to the north and Barnegat Lighthouse to the south. It also served as a land­mark for near by Sea Girt In let and Wreck Pond.
              By the early 1900s. there were some 40 light stations - lighthouses. lightships and range lights - along New Jersey's 130-mile coastline.
              Just over half of them survive. But only 11 of the original lighthouses. including Sea Girt. are open to the public</p>
