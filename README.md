## Sea Girt Website Project, Checkpoint 2

This website was my first site created using SASS!

This uses Sass and a plugin OwlCarousel.  FitVid is also used, but I decided not to implement a video in the final design.

There are 7 pages in total and next I will be learning to use PHP to get this
site into WordPress.
